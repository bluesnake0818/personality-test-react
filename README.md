# hangfive Personality Test - zodiac signs on a date

## Why I Started This
- Last of the four zodiac app series. 
- Always thought it would be great to combine a personality test with the zodiac content because, 
  - users invest their time and energy while answering the questions ==> become more invested in the results. 
  - more "compatible" data points to work with for matching in social discovery. 

## Key Features
- Personality Test
- Zodiac + Personality Test => combined analysis
- Save test history
