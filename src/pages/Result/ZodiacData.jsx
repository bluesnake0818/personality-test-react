    archetype: 'The Visionary',
    desc: "Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, compassionate and sincere, Rabbits are the heart and soul of every group that they're in.",
    desc1: "Rabbits radiate energy in all directions, keeping busy to share the fruits of their efforts with others—often forgetting to leave something for themselves in their enthusiasm to give. But radiation means dispersion, and so may leave them feeling worn out or empty inside even as it brings variety and excitement to their lives. ",
    desc2: "As such, Rabbits need to learn to pick their battles carefully, concentrating on achieving one specific goal at a time instead of trying to tackle everything at once. This overflowing energy also gives many Rabbits a chronic case of itchy feet, leading them to move multiple times over the course of their lives.",
    desc3: "Gentle and socially active Rabbits are domestic souls who are happiest when surrounded by family and friends. They get very attached to their chosen homes, and enjoy expressing themselves through interior decorating and entertaining guests, but can be quite unhappy when forced to settle somewhere not up to their high standards. ",
    desc4: "Their idealism lets Rabbits instinctively understand that values are relative and that differences are to be embraced and celebrated. They reject authority-based hierarchies in favor of structures that treat everybody equally, and despite their natural anxiety have a knack for making the best decisions for everyone involved.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Rabbits are the concentrated essence of the 'responsible friend': high-strung and demanding yet conflict-avoidant doormats who aren't satisfied with anything but refuse to commit to any side in case they upset someone (ironically making them extremely annoying to just about everyone). ",
    desc6: "Their keen sensitivity can also lead them to be nitpicky and hypercritical, and they tend to feel unmoored when uncertain about their place in society. Getting involved in local politics or volunteering for a community project they're interested in can thus be great ways for lost Rabbits to carve out a niche for themselves.",
