    desc: 'Curious, clever, resourceful, and decisive, Rats are famously sharp and funny. They maneuver their way out of any tight spot with ease.',
    desc1: 'Rats are flexible and creative thinkers, good at ferreting out tips and tricks to get around problems rather than tackle them head on. They often have their own special ways of doing things, which may be unconventional but hey, if it works, it works!',
    desc2: "Although their quick wit, excellent taste, and overflowing charm naturally attract them the admiration and envy of others, Rats generally lead modest and practical lifestyles. They dislike excess and wastefulness, thinking through their purchases carefully and often making great efforts to reduce, reuse, and recycle.",
    desc3: "As mature and grounded as Rats can be, they are very often their own worst enemy. Their overactive senses of self-criticism strangle their potential, and they're frequently ambushed by the blues, especially when alone. Their tendency to lick their wounds alone in these moments can also hurt the people who care about them.",
    desc4: "Cautious Rats' strong affinity for success and self-preservation, makes them well suited for stable, low-risk investments. They are easily motivated by money, which can tip over into greed at times, but they also make generous and loyal friends who are always ready to lend a listening ear.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Rats are self-absorbed ham actors in the tragedies of their own making, prone to evading personal responsibility by convincing themselves they aren't in control of their own lives when they're actually just addicted to self-pity. When will you learn, Rats, that your actions have consequences?",
    desc6: "Just as rats move quietly in the dark, Rats are full of secrets, hiding an array of ambitions, talents, and very often a whole bunch of problems in their personal relationships (especially when it comes to their romantic lives). Living lowkey has its charms, but as a wise man once said, you'll never shine if you don't glow!",

    desc: 'Oxes are cool and collected team players with strong principles who uphold justice and equality over personal profit and never, ever give up the fight.',
    desc1: "Oxes are patient, Oxes are loyal―and Oxes dig in their heels against any attempt to control or change them. Bullheaded and stubborn as...a mule, Oxes' singleminded drive lets them get any job done, but as fairly inflexible thinkers, they often disregard shortcuts or creative solutions to cling to established procedures.",
    desc2: "But this stubbornness means Oxes aren't easily swayed by bandwagoning or rabblerousing, keeping their balance despite the chaos of public sentiment. Their refusal to compromise on their ideals both wins them the admiration of those who share those values and allows them to stay steady as a rock, always sure of who they are.",
    desc3: "Protective and reliable Oxes value their family, friends, and community above all. They are rock solid in their support of 'their people,' always pull more than their fair share of the weight, and don't hesitate to make sacrifices for others' sakes: all qualities that mark them as decisive, caring, and dependable leaders. ",
    desc4: "Oxes' loyalty and deep affection toward their loved ones leads them to take great joy and comfort in their presence. However, their unfortunate tendency to repress their feelings instead of addressing them leaves them at risk for loneliness, misunderstandings, and burned bridges. (Emotional vulnerability won't kill you, Oxes!)",
    desc5: "At their worst, Oxes are reactionary traditionalists who won't listen to advice or reason and just want these dang kids to get off their lawn and listen to some real music for once. But those who do not listen cannot grow, and so an unwary Ox lives in danger of being left behind by the changing tides of history.",
    desc6: "Oxes are also not the most observant of people, and may occasionally have trouble recognizing or responding to jokes, especially if they're presented with a straight face. If you don't want to become just another 'back in my day' type shaking their fist at the sky, you've got to lighten up, old soul!",

    desc1: "The boldest and most driven of the zodiacs, independent, free-spirited Tigers are loud, opinionated, and ready to pounce. Want to break a Tiger? Go for the pride. Like Oxes, Tigers live and die by their convictions, but unlike Oxes' bone-deep dedication to their principles, Tigers are usually fixated on winning the argument. ",
    desc2: "But Tigers' best traits are their open-mindedness toward the new and unknown, and the courage, flexibility, and potential for change that lets them fairly consider and accept other perspectives as long as they aren't immediately threatening their pride. Tigers' greatest strength is that they never stop learning and growing.",
    desc3: "Tigers crave fame and recognition, and their sheer willpower both lets them accomplish great feats and leads them straight into trouble. Although their intensity, sense of purpose, and cheerfulness make them good leaders, they work better alone, and are perfect for positions that require frequent travel and an adventurous soul.",
    desc4: "Big dreamers who can't stand being chained to one place or forced into a routine, Tigers are always ready to bet it all on the chance of a big haul and can lose sight of what they have chasing waterfalls. They're also susceptible to feelings of frustration, despair, and inadequacy when those dreams fall through. ",
    desc5: "At their worst, Tigers are reckless, impulsive, attention-seeking Jackass types who make absolutely terrible snap decisions that even they can't defend in hindsight. (On the bright side, it gives them incredible party stories.) Innocent and a little clumsy, they often mess up social situations by trying to be 'provocative.'", 
    desc6: "They also tend to be sprinters, not marathon runners, either leaving their work to the last minute or burning out from trying to do everything all at once instead of pacing it out. A little foresight and planning can go a long way, so look everywhere before you leap! And you'd better have figured out how you're going to land!",

    desc1: "Rabbits radiate energy in all directions, keeping busy to share the fruits of their efforts with others—often forgetting to leave something for themselves in their enthusiasm to give. But radiation means dispersion, and so may leave them feeling worn out or empty inside even as it brings variety and excitement to their lives. ",
    desc2: "As such, Rabbits need to learn to pick their battles carefully, concentrating on achieving one specific goal at a time instead of trying to tackle everything at once. This overflowing energy also gives many Rabbits a chronic case of itchy feet, leading them to move multiple times over the course of their lives.",
    desc3: "Gentle and socially active Rabbits are domestic souls who are happiest when surrounded by family and friends. They get very attached to their chosen homes, and enjoy expressing themselves through interior decorating and entertaining guests, but can be quite unhappy when forced to settle somewhere not up to their high standards. ",
    desc4: "Their idealism lets Rabbits instinctively understand that values are relative and that differences are to be embraced and celebrated. They reject authority-based hierarchies in favor of structures that treat everybody equally, and despite their natural anxiety have a knack for making the best decisions for everyone involved.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Rabbits are the concentrated essence of the 'responsible friend': high-strung and demanding yet conflict-avoidant doormats who aren't satisfied with anything but refuse to commit to any side in case they upset someone (ironically making them extremely annoying to just about everyone). ",
    desc6: "Their keen sensitivity can also lead them to be nitpicky and hypercritical, and they tend to feel unmoored when uncertain about their place in society. Getting involved in local politics or volunteering for a community project they're interested in can thus be great ways for lost Rabbits to carve out a niche for themselves.",

    desc1: "Dragons are often stereotyped as egotistical, power-hungry control freaks, but that's...not entirely not completely untrue! Fired up in all they do, Dragons are tireless and relentless powerhouses who make incredible things happen. A Dragon who isn't barreling toward their dream hasn't given up, they're just taking a rest! ",
    desc2: "Though Dragons may have big egos, they have even bigger hearts. Fearless and energetic leaders, Dragons bring people together with the force of their charisma to charm them into uniting under the same vision. Their commanding presence and natural magnetism draw attention wherever they go, making Dragons lucky in love as well. ",
    desc3: "Idealists who love thinking and talking about the future, Dragons are great at motivating themselves to burst through obstacles with the promise of rewards to come. Their uncompromising perfectionism may frustrate or exhaust others, but it's what lets them knock out challenge after challenge in the pursuit of their goals.",
    desc4: "Decisive and daring Dragons keep a cool head in crisis, taking bold action to turn the situation around. They may even look forward to trouble so they can swoop in and save the day. But Dragons' heroic strength often fizzles out before the end, leaving them with projects that are technically complete—just don't look too close! ",
    desc5: "At their worst, Dragons aim for Don Corleone but end up hitting Patrick Bateman, performing dramatic, fire-breathing narcissists with an overinflated sense of self-importance and delusions of grandeur. Their need to flex their authority can also manifest in power trips that others find off-putting and unreasonable. ",
    desc6: "But Dragons often conceal past hurts and present insecurities underneath their pretenses of perfection, and some nice manageable disappointments can actually serve to bring them back to earth, helping them realize that perfection is an impossible goal and that failure is an opportunity for growth. Go forth and slay, Dragons!",

    desc1: "Just as snakes twist their way around obstacles rather than trying to move mountains, Snakes use their supreme social smarts and meticulous competence to steer the situation to their advantage. Their hard work and cunning maneuvers allow Snakes to rise to the top to achieve their ultimate goal: to do things The Right Way. ",
    desc2: "Fundamentally, Snakes' thirst for power springs from an overactive sense of responsibility for others and an unwavering confidence that they know what's best for others, whether they agree or not. This quality makes Snakes quite polarizing, seen by some as charismatic and reliable and others as high-handed and suffocating.",
    desc3: "Analytical yet intuitive, Snakes are expressive, self-disciplined, and good with money, but their impatience and baldfaced ambition may burn out their energy or undermine their standing with their peers before they see a project through. A little humility and empathy will let Snakes get out of their own way and ensure success!",
    desc4: "Sprinters rather than marathon runners in stamina, the one thing Snakes never fail to hold onto to the end is a grudge. Snakes never forget, rarely forgive, and always get their revenge one way or another. Once a Snake rears to strike, their aim never fails—and their target may never even know who brought them down, or why.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Snakes idolize Miranda Priestly but end up mimicking Bruce Banner. Composure is the key to overcoming setbacks, but Snakes' overflowing Yang energy equips them with a short fuse and a volcanic temper, and their envy and insecurity can make them ticking time bombs that go off with a bang at the sight of trouble.",
    desc6: "But when channeled healthily, this explosive energy can be drawn upon to inspire Snakes to break through their limits. Let your spite work for you, not against you! Do your homework on effective techniques for managing stress and harnessing your emotions so you can work on finding solutions rather than blowing up unproductively.",

Born stars with distinct tastes and unique senses of style, Horses leap at any chance to travel, move to, or otherwise adventure in places new and beautiful, charging forth with reckless abandon.",
    desc2: "Horses' curiosity and thirst for new experiences lead them to approach even strangers with ease, and their personal networks (which include everyone from 'my pre-K teacher' to 'the guy who fixed my Roomba last week who told me about these tricks his iguanas can do') can often strike more reserved signs as alien and terrifying. ",
    desc3: "The flip side of Horses' dynamism is their restlessness and distractibility. Laser-focused when working on their interests, when faced with tasks they find boring Horses are lured away by anything, often spending hours investigating completely unrelated topics or reorganizing their entire rooms before remembering their duties.",
    desc4: "Happy-go-lucky and highly independent Horses can't stand being constrained, chafing at the bit under authority or regulation. Perpetually dreaming of freedom rather than making plans for a stable future, Horses embody an essential rebelliousness of nature that sparks in them the spirit of criticism, opposition, and revolution.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Horses have permanent hoof-in-mouth disease, blurting out insensitive judgments, hurtful critiques, and everyone else's secrets. Their discomfort with awkward silences and difficulty in holding back their thoughts and feelings can make them come off as uncaring or unreliable despite their good intentions. ",
    desc6: "Horses overachieve when they achieve at all, or else crash and burn, leading to erratic ups and downs rather than understated but consistent results. Horses are naturally highly susceptible to being influenced by their environment and immediate circumstances, and so must learn to counter this tendency by taming their Fire.",

Goats live quiet, economical lives, avoiding both excessive excitement and extra expense, but also harbor a deep curiosity about the world beyond their front door and a tendency for their fates to lead them afar. ",
    desc2: "Add in a knack for picking up foreign languages and an appreciation for the value of spirituality, faith, and intuition, and it's clear to see why Goats are often said to have been born to wander. Goats' wanderlust may alarm those around them, but no one can stop a Goat from setting out on the journey written in their fate.",
    desc3: "Just as goats seem gentle until provoked, Goats are characterized by duality. They are cheerful but solitary, spirited but hiding fears, forward-looking but holding onto past hurts. Goats are naïve with delicate artistic sensibilities, but also proud, determined, focused, and patient, enduring hardships for the future payoff. ",
    desc4: "However, the unfortunate combination of sensitivity and stubborn persistence that leads Goats to stick it out no matter how bad things get makes them highly susceptible to debuffs both mental and physical, such as perpetual muscle tension, stress headaches, indigestion, anxiety, self-doubt, and depression.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Goats are high-strung, insecure emotional vampires whose constant demands for support and reassurance can drain and frustrate those around them. Goats can also be moody, self-absorbed, and too quick to judge, getting so overwhelmed by their own problems that they either dismiss or fail to even notice others'. ",
    desc6: "While Goats take pleasure in making sacrifices for the happiness of those they consider theirs, they can be coldly indifferent or even outright hostile toward those outside this circle. It behooves them to see things through a different pair of (maybe round-pupilled) eyes from time to time, or else risk going woolly in the head.",

Their neverending search for novelty fills their lives with excitement, but can also leave them feeling empty, cynical, and alienated from the simple joys of existence. ",
    desc2: "Monkeys' intense but fleeting fascination with the new means they tend to start strong and finish weak, blasting out of the gate only to stumble before the finish line. This can hurt Monkeys' pride in their abilities, giving them a gloomy conviction that they're lazy or undisciplined that they put on a show of cheer to hide. ",
    desc3: "Ambitious, eloquent, and resolute, Monkeys are adaptive improvisers with their finger on the pulse of society and an instinct for when to raise and fold. Emboldened by a sense of superiority springing from their confidence in their intellects, Monkeys easily make decisions that strike others as domineering or even ruthless. ",
    desc4: "Well versed in the clout of getting their hands on crucial details before anyone else, or of influencing public opinion with appeals to their values or fears, Monkeys' fascination with authority gives them an interest in politics, a talent for policy work, and a tendency to place great emphasis on hierarchical power structures.",
    desc5: "At their worst, Monkeys are fickle, pretentious, judgmental, contemptuous of others, and loud: in other words, the essence of obnoxious basement dweller. Without self-restraint and humility, Monkeys can be condescending at best and outright cruel at worst in their territory of expertise, crossing lines to make hurtful 'jokes.'",
    desc6: "Learning to listen to others with sincerity and empathy―and not to gather material for their next sick burn―is a must for them. Quick-to-bore Monkeys are also prone to short honeymoon periods in their relationships, after which they leave the other person hanging with vague non-explanations about how 'it just isn't working.'",

They are homebodies with distinct preferences about their surrounding environments, often being unable to relax in messy spaces.",
    desc2: "Sensitive and sharp Roosters have the strongest Metal energy of all the zodiacs, and much like metal itself, this energy must be refined to be used. Roosters thus need to anchor themselves in environments that can nurture their potential, explaining their craving for stability and their tendency to reject change or transition.",

And although Roosters may take a while to come to a decision, once they do they commit to it, defending their choices with a conviction born of long consideration.",
